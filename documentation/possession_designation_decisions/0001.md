## Context
I want to add information to the tracking data about which team is in possession at any moment in time. This information will be generated from the accompanying event data (which already has frame information for the start and end of each event). This information will need to be extrapolated by myself as it doesn't exist ready-made on the event (or tracking) data.

## Decision
I will assign a logic to the main event types about whether a team making that action is in control of possession or not. There will be three categories: team in possession, opponent in possession, neither team in possession.

However, there will also be a fourth state: out of possession. This will need to be created with markers for the end and start of in-play possession periods, which will necessitate using the event subtypes as well.

The desired end result is a dataframe with a row for `start_frame` and `status`. This will be merged with the tracking data frames using `pd.mergeof`. This information will then be added to each frame's record in the tracking data.

## Status
(Taken, Pending, Deprecated, Superseded)
Taken, pending completion

## Consequences
### Positive
- It's a relatively simple system for assigning possession team
- The use of a neutral state both seems to help with the ease of logic while also being a preferred logic of my own
### Negative
- Only using the event types for possession state could be an oversimplification
### Neutral
